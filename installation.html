<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
    For now it it's only tested with Rails 2.3.8, and it would not work with other version

    We are working to support all rails version from 2.2.* to 3.*, and we make update when we ready
</p>

<h2>you need folder features </h2>

<p>
    if you don't have folder features inside you rails application folder, it would be the best
    to boostrap cucumber inside you application, instruction are <a href="">here</a>
</p>

<h2>install cucumber fm</h2>

<pre>
            script/plugin install git://github.com/cs3b/cucumber_fm.git
        </pre>

<h2>start application</h2>

<pre>
            script/server
        </pre>
<p>
    And open documentation features page, by default below link should work.
    <br/><a href="http://localhost:3000/documentation/features">http://localhost:3000/documentation/features</a>
</p>

<p>
    it will ask you for password but for know it doesn't matter what you fill in just press OK
