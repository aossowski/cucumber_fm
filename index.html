<h1>Cucumber Feature Manager</h1>
<p>

    We are storing specifications for our projects as cucumber features, but we extend usage (look at example below) and
    add some new
    conventions to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>make management possible</li>
    <li>improve collaboration with client</li>
    <li>attach estimation direct to scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>
    so we were able to remove duplication of information that was splited across many places,
    we are continuously improving our approach and working hard to make it more user friendly in use.
</p>

<p>
    It is still beta but if you wanna test then go ahead, your feedback would be valuable
