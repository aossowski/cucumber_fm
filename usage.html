<h1>Usage</h1>

        <p>
            the best way is to look on <a href='http://demo.cucumber.fm'>demo site</a> where you can try how it works
        </p>

<h2>Business Overview</h2>

        <p>
            it show all features and scenarios - when you enter demo site it has redirection that aggregate scenarios by
            milestone
        </p>

        <p>
            you can review or edit feature content by clicking on feature or scenario
        </p>

        <p> on the right there is filter panel that allow scope scenarios by tag</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <pre>@mc @m8</pre>
                means that i want to see all scenarios that are assigned to developer mc nad milestone m8
            </li>
            <li>
                <pre>@mc @_todo,@_spec ~@m0</pre>
                all scenarios for developer mc with status todo or spec but without assigned to milestone 0 (backlog)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            we can also aggregate by two dimension, i very often use status and bucket combination
        </p>

        <p>
            last option is adding new feature file ( you can write feature name like this: Knowledge Base - Pro Categories
            and the filename would be Knowledge_Base___Pro_Categories.feature
        </p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

        <p>the main goal of this view is to have common sense of how the project is going on, it can also be scoped by tags
        as same as in business overview. the most common is scoping by current milestone</p>

        <p>in future we would add all milestones list - including backlog (@m0) and future milestones</p>
